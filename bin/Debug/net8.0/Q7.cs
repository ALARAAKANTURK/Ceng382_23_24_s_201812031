Upon reviewing last week's code, I've noticed that the ReservationHandler class seems to take on multiple responsibilities. This appears to violate the Single Responsibility Principle. For instance, it combines tasks such as reservation management (AddReservation, DeleteReservation) and constructing/displaying the weekly schedule (DisplayWeeklySchedule) within a single class. This approach could make the class sensitive to changes and increase maintenance costs.

Additionally, it seems that Dependency Injection (DI) principles were not applied appropriately in the code from last week. Dependencies are instantiated directly within the classes, leading to tight coupling. Adhering to DI principles by delegating dependency management to a DI container promotes loose coupling between components and enhances testability and maintenance ease.

Therefore, restructuring your code to adhere to the Single Responsibility Principle and utilizing Dependency Injection principles would make your code more modular, easier to maintain, and scalable. Following these principles is particularly crucial in complex systems like web applications, as it improves code quality and enhances development processes in the long run.
